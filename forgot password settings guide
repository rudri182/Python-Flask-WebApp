I think this chapter is the chapter that most of viewers have problem about authentication with GMAIL. After I did a bunches of trial and error, spent like several hour to figure it out what's wrong due to I am using Windows and VS Code. Finally, I found my own solution. It might not work with you guys but I hope it somewhat useful though. The steps are:

Prerequisite
1. you need a valid gmail account which means you need to know Email address and Password
2. you have to add those email address and password to Windows System Variable.  (EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASSWORD)
3. you need to turn on '
Less secure app access' in your Gmail Account Security.

Once all above prerequisite has been done, try to check that you can get those variable from command line first.
1. go to command prompt, type Echo %EMAIL_USER% and the expect return output is your email. if the %EMAIL_USER% also return then you configure step 2 above incorrectly.

2. Do not execute Python file from VS Code. This issue similar to Pycharm user as well. I think the VS Code may not be able to access OS environment somehow (possibly I do not sure how to configure that.) The alternative solution is activate your Virtual Environment via Command Line and then run Python via Command Line -- Open command prompt and go to your Python Program folder. CD Scripts and execute 'activate'

2.1 test whether your Python can get OS environment by execute Python and import os and then print (os.environ.get("EMAIL_USER")) The expect output is your email address.

2.2 Once it done, you go back to your main program folder and execute Python run.py

3. Try to reset password. Email should be sent. I got the email now.

Thanks Corey for an wonderful tutorial. <3ï»¿
